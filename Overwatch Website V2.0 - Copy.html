          <ul>
            <li>I also like to play Soldier 76, he is my main attack character.</li>
            <li>He is simple to play, but hard to master.</li>
            <li>He is an all-around character, his heal makes him a team player.</li>

          <ul>
            <li>I like to play D.Va, she is my main, because I am good at playing as her.</li>
            <li>She is a stellar tank, due to her defence matrix.</li>
            <li>D.Va's ultimate is good at clearing the objective</li>
            <li>Her mechless form is also quite effective</li>

        <div class="list">
          <ul>
            <li>I like to play Winston, he is a very effective tank due to his shield.</li>
            <li>He is also a very moblie character,due to his jump, he can bypass defences and jump to the point</li>
            <li>He is not my main tank, as I prefer D.Va</li>
